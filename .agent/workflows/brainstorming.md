description: Design features through collaborative brainstorming before implementation

# Brainstorming Workflow

Use this before any creative work - creating features, building components, adding functionality.

## The Process

### 1. Understanding the Idea
- Check current project state (files, docs, recent commits)
- Ask questions ONE AT A TIME to refine the idea
- Prefer multiple choice questions when possible
- Focus on: purpose, constraints, success criteria

### 2. Exploring Approaches
- Propose 2-3 different approaches with trade-offs
- Lead with your recommendation and explain why

### 3. Presenting the Design
- Break design into sections of 200-300 words
- Ask after each section whether it looks right
- Cover: architecture, components, data flow, error handling, testing

## After the Design
- Write design to `docs/plans/YYYY-MM-DD-<topic>-design.md`
- Commit the design document
- Ask: "Ready to set up for implementation?"

## Key Principles
- **One question at a time** - Don't overwhelm
- **YAGNI ruthlessly** - Remove unnecessary features
- **Explore alternatives** - Always propose 2-3 approaches
- **Incremental validation** - Present in sections, validate each
